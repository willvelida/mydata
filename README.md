# My Data Project

I have been collecting fitness information through my Fitbit Blaze wearable device and I'm creating this project to gain some insights into my fitness behaviours over time. The current objectives for this project are:

* Visualize my fitness data to communicate results to end-users.
* Predict future insights from exisiting data.
* Provide a means of interacting with the data in real time.

These objectives will evolve and change over time.
