## Overview

I have been collecting fitness information through my Fitbit Blaze wearable device and I'm creating this project to gain some insights into my fitness behaviours over time. The current objectives for this project are:

* Visualize my fitness data to communicate results to end-users.
* Predict future insights from exisiting data.
* Provide a means of interacting with the data in real time.

These objectives will evolve and change over time.

## Developer Log

If you want to read about the development of this project, you can do so by checking out my [blog](https://williamvelida.com/category/mydata-project/).

## Website

[MyData project website](http://mydataproject.azurewebsites.net/)

This project has a seperate web application that will be used to communicate insights into the data to end users. The GitHub repository for the website has been kept seperate for deployment reasons and can be found [here](https://github.com/willvelida/mydataweb).
